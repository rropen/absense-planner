## Overview

Although R-R has existing systems to manage and view absence, they fail to meet some basic needs.
1. Allow any R-R computer user to view any colleagues absence information (with appropriate protection of people's data and compliance to any legistation on privacy)
2. Include 3rd party colleagues/contractors as well as regular staff
3. globally accessible

This project aims to overcome these deficiencies
